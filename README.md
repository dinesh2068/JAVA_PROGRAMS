# Java Training Repository
### Welcome to my Java Training Repository! 👨‍💻📚
This repository contains the concepts, code examples, and practice problems I worked on during my recent Java training. The training was designed to build a solid foundation in core Java and introduce essential problem-solving techniques using algorithms and data structures.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
The following key Java concepts were covered during the training:

#### ✅ Core Java
 
 - Data Types & Variables
 - Operators & Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
 - Functions and Scope
 - Arrays and Strings
 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
 - Classes & Objects
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
 - Abstraction
 - Encapsulation

#### ✅ Intermediate Topics

 - Recursion
 -  Searching & Sorting Algorithms
 -  1D & 2D Array Operations
 - String Manipulations
 -  Time and Space Complexity Analysis

#### ✅ Algorithmic Problem Solving

  - Recursion vs Iteration
  - Backtracking Algorithms
  - N-Queens Problem
  - Maze Solving
  - Subset/Permutation Generation
